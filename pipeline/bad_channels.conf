# Bad Channels Configuration
# ===========================
# Specify manual bad channel IDs for specific recording sessions.
# These channels will be interpolated during preprocessing and then removed.
#
# Format:
#   session_name = channel_id1, channel_id2, channel_id3
#
# Matching:
# - Uses case-insensitive partial matching
# - If session name contains the key (or vice versa), channels are applied
#
# Channel ID formats supported:
# - Integer indices: 0, 5, 127
# - AP-prefixed indices: AP0, AP5, AP127
# - Direct channel IDs (as they appear in your recording)

# === Add your session-specific bad channels below ===
# Format: session_name = channel1, channel2, channel3
# NO brackets - just comma-separated values!
# Examples:
# SL412-Punish1 = AP0, AP5, AP127
# SL412-Reward1 = 0, 1, 2

# Noisy unit count for channels: {20: 71, 206: 15, 3: 14, 313: 10, 314: 6, 1: 6, 296: 6, 294: 5, 298: 4, 310: 4, 328: 4, 312: 3, 284: 3, 292: 3, 286: 3}
