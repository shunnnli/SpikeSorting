# Bad Channels Configuration
# ===========================
# Specify manual bad channel IDs for specific recording sessions.
# These channels will be interpolated during preprocessing and then removed.
#
# Format:
#   session_name = channel_id1, channel_id2, channel_id3
#
# Matching:
# - Uses case-insensitive partial matching
# - If session name contains the key (or vice versa), channels are applied
#
# Channel ID formats supported:
# - Integer indices: 0, 5, 127
# - AP-prefixed indices: AP0, AP5, AP127
# - Direct channel IDs (as they appear in your recording)
#
# Examples:
# SL412_Punish1 = AP0, AP5, AP127
# 20251211 = 10, 20, 30
# probe_A = AP100, AP200
